    "A decision tree classifier is a type of supervised learning algorithm that is used for both classification and regression tasks. It works by splitting the data into subsets based on the value of input features. This process is repeated recursively, creating a tree-like model of decisions.\n",

    "Entropy: Entropy is a measure of impurity or uncertainty in a set of data. In the context of decision trees, entropy is used to evaluate the homogeneity of a group of instances with respect to their class labels. Mathematically, entropy is calculated using the formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "entropy(S) = -∑ (p(c) * log2(p(c))) where S is the set of instances, p(c) is the probability of an instance belonging to class c, and the summation is performed over all distinct class labels. If all instances in a set belong to the same class, the entropy is 0, indicating perfect homogeneity.\n",

    "Information Gain: Information gain measures the reduction in entropy achieved by splitting the data based on a particular feature. It helps in determining the most informative feature to use for making decisions in the decision tree. Mathematically, information gain is calculated as:\n",

The information gain is the difference between the entropy of the current set and the weighted average of entropies of the subsets after the split.\n",

    "Building the Tree: The decision tree algorithm selects the feature with the highest information gain at each node to create a split. This feature becomes the decision criterion for that node. The instances are divided into subsets based on the values of the selected feature, and the process is repeated recursively for each subset until a stopping criterion is met.\n",

    "Leaf Node and Class Prediction: Once the splitting process reaches a stopping criterion, such as reaching a maximum depth or a minimum number of instances, a leaf node is created. The majority class label of the instances in that leaf node is assigned as the predicted class label.\n",

    "The mathematical intuition behind decision tree classification lies in the concept of entropy and information gain. By selecting the feature that maximizes the information gain, the algorithm effectively identifies the most informative features for splitting the data and creating an optimal decision tree structure that predicts class labels with the least amount of uncertainty or impurity.\n"
