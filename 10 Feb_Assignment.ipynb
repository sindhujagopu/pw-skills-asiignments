    "#Q1. Which function is used to open a file? What are the different modes of opening a file? Explain each mode of file opening.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function used to open a file in Python is the open() function. This function takes two arguments: the first argument is the name of the file and the second argument is the mode in which the file should be opened.\n",
    "\n",
    "The different modes of opening a file are:\n",
    "\n",
    "'r' (Read Only): This is the default mode. It opens the file for reading only. If the file does not exist, it raises an error.\n",
    "\n",
    "'w' (Write Only): This mode opens the file for writing only. If the file already exists, it will overwrite the file. If the file does not exist, it will create a new file.\n",
    "\n",
    "'a' (Append Only): This mode opens the file for writing, but instead of overwriting the file, it appends the data to the end of the file. If the file does not exist, it will create a new file.\n",

    "#Q2. Why close() function is used? Why is it important to close a file?\n",
    "\n",
    "The close() function is used to close an open file. It is important to close a file after you are done working with it because:\n",
    "\n",
    "Releasing resources: When a file is opened, the operating system allocates resources, such as memory, to handle the file. Closing the file releases these resources back to the operating system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Avoiding data corruption: When you write to a file, the data is not immediately written to the physical storage device. Instead, it is temporarily stored in a buffer, and periodically flushed to the storage device. If you do not close the file, this data may be lost if the buffer is not flushed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Preventing file locking: If a file is open and not closed, it may be locked and prevent other processes or applications from accessing or modifying it. This can lead to unexpected errors and data corruption.\n",
    "\n",
    "Improving performance: If you open and close a file multiple times, it is more efficient to close the file after each use rather than keeping it open for a long period of time. This reduces the amount of resources the operating system needs to allocate, and improves performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, it is a best practice to always close a file after you are done working with it, to avoid these and other potential issues."
