It evaluates whether the clusters are composed of similar data points in terms of their class labels. A clustering result is considered homogeneous if all clusters contain data points from a single class. Homogeneity is calculated using the following formula:\n",

    "To calculate homogeneity and completeness, you need the true class labels and the cluster assignments. The entropy values can be computed based on the frequency distributions of the class labels and cluster assignments.
