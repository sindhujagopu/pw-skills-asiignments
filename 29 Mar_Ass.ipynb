    "`Lasso regression`, also known as L1 regularization, is a type of linear regression that adds a penalty term to the regression model's cost function to prevent overfitting. The penalty term is the sum of the absolute values of the regression coefficients multiplied by a hyperparameter, which controls the strength of the regularization.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main difference between `Lasso regression` and other regression techniques, such as `Ridge regression`, is the type of penalty term used. In `Ridge regression`, the penalty term is the sum of the squares of the regression coefficients, while in `Lasso regression`, it is the sum of their absolute values. This leads to a difference in the way the regularization works. `Ridge regression` tends to shrink all the coefficients towards zero, while `Lasso regression` can completely eliminate some of the coefficients by setting them to zero. This makes `Lasso regression` a useful tool for feature selection, as it can automatically identify and exclude irrelevant or redundant features from the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another difference between `Lasso regression` and other regression techniques is that it can handle a large number of predictors, even when the number of observations is smaller than the number of predictors. This is because Lasso regression has a tendency to perform feature selection and can identify the most important predictors even in situations with a large number of potential predictors."

    "The main advantage of using `Lasso Regression` in feature selection is that it can automatically identify and exclude irrelevant or redundant features from the model. Lasso Regression adds a penalty term to the regression model's cost function that is proportional to the sum of the absolute values of the regression coefficients, multiplied by a hyperparameter that controls the strength of the regularization.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result, `Lasso Regression` has a tendency to shrink the coefficients of less important features towards zero, and may completely eliminate some of them by setting their coefficients to zero. This feature selection process can be very useful in situations where the number of features is large relative to the number of observations, and identifying the most relevant predictors can be a challenging task.\n",
    "\n",
    "By reducing the number of features in the model, `Lasso Regression` can help to improve model interpretability, reduce overfitting, and improve prediction performance. It can also help to reduce computational complexity, as models with fewer features are typically faster to train and evaluate."

This parameter controls the strength of the regularization applied to the model, and determines how much the size of the coefficients will be penalized. A higher alpha value will result in stronger regularization, and therefore smaller coefficients, which can help to reduce overfitting and improve the generalization performance of the model. However, setting the alpha parameter too high can lead to underfitting, where the model is too simple to capture the complexity of the data.\n",

In this process, the data is divided into k subsets, and the model is trained and evaluated k times, each time using a different subset as the validation set. The optimal value of alpha is chosen based on the performance metric, such as mean squared error or R-squared, that is calculated across all the validation sets."

    "`Lasso` Regression is a linear regression technique, and as such, it is designed to model linear relationships between the predictors and the response variable. However, it can be used for non-linear regression problems by first transforming the predictors into non-linear functions before applying Lasso Regression.\n",

    "One common approach is to use polynomial features, which involves transforming the original predictors into higher-order polynomial terms. For example, if the original predictor is x, we can create a new predictor x^2, x^3, and so on, up to a specified degree. The resulting polynomial features can capture non-linear relationships between the predictors and the response variable, and can be used as inputs for Lasso Regression.\n",

    "To address `multicollinearity`, it is often recommended to preprocess the data by removing or combining highly correlated variables before applying Lasso Regression.
