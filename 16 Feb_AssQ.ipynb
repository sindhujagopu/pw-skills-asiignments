    "A database is a collection of structured data that is stored and managed in a computer system. It provides a mechanism for organizing, storing, and retrieving information efficiently. Databases can be used for a variety of purposes, such as storing customer information, financial records, or product catalogs.\n",
    "SQL (Structured Query Language) and NoSQL (Not only SQL) are two types of database management systems (DBMS). SQL databases are relational databases that store data in tables, which are related to each other using keys or other defined relationships. SQL databases are best suited for applications that require complex queries and transactions, such as financial systems and inventory management.\n",
    "On the other hand, NoSQL databases are non-relational databases that do not use tables to store data. Instead, NoSQL databases use different data models, such as key-value, document-oriented, or graph-based, to store and retrieve data. NoSQL databases are often used for applications that require fast and flexible access to data, such as real-time analytics, social media, and mobile applications.\n",
    "The main difference between SQL and NoSQL databases is in their data models and how they handle data. SQL databases are generally better suited for applications that require complex queries and transactions, while NoSQL databases are better suited for applications that require fast and flexible access to data."
