To use linear regression effectively, it is important to be aware of certain assumptions that must hold for the model to be reliable. Here are some of the key assumptions of linear regression:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `Linearity`: The relationship between the dependent variable and the independent variables is linear. This means that changes in the independent variables should result in proportional changes in the dependent variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `Independence`: The observations are independent of each other. This means that the value of the dependent variable for one observation does not depend on the value of the dependent variable for any other observation.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `Homoscedasticity`: The variance of the residuals (the difference between the observed values and the predicted values) is constant across all levels of the independent variable(s). This means that the spread of the residuals is the same for all values of the independent variable(s).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. `Normality`: The residuals are normally distributed. This means that the distribution of the residuals should resemble a bell-shaped curve.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. `No multicollinearity`: The independent variables are not highly correlated with each other. This means that there should not be a strong linear relationship between any two independent variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "To check whether these assumptions hold in a given dataset, there are several diagnostic tools that can be used. These include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `Residual plots`: Plotting the residuals against the predicted values can help to identify any patterns in the data that violate the assumptions of linearity or homoscedasticity.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `Normal probability plots`: Plotting the residuals against a normal distribution can help to identify any departures from normality.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `Cook's distance`: This measure can be used to identify any influential observations that may be skewing the results of the regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. `Variance inflation factor` (VIF): This measure can be used to identify any multicollinearity between the independent variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. `Durbin-Watson test`: This test can be used to identify any autocorrelation in the residuals.\n",

    "In a linear regression model, the slope and intercept are the parameters that determine the relationship between the independent variable(s) and the dependent variable. Here's how to interpret these parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `Slope`: The slope represents the change in the dependent variable for a one-unit change in the independent variable, holding all other independent variables constant. A positive slope indicates that as the independent variable increases, the dependent variable also increases, while a negative slope indicates that as the independent variable increases, the dependent variable decreases.\n",

Suppose we want to model the relationship between a person's age (in years) and their income (in thousands of dollars per year). We collect data on the age and income of 100 individuals and fit a linear regression model to the data. The resulting model is:\n",

This is not a meaningful value, but it provides a reference point for interpreting the slope. The slope is 1.5, which means that for every one-year increase in age, we expect the person's income to increase by 1,500 (since the income is measured in thousands of dollars per year). In other words, the model predicts that a person who is 30 years old will have an income of 55,000 per year (10,000 + 1,500 * 30)"

    "`Gradient descent` is a widely used optimization algorithm that is used to minimize the cost function of a machine learning model. The goal of gradient descent is to find the values of the model parameters (i.e., coefficients) that result in the lowest possible cost (i.e., error) on the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic idea of `gradient descent` is to iteratively update the model parameters in the direction of the steepest descent of the cost function. This is done by computing the gradient (i.e., the partial derivative) of the cost function with respect to each parameter, which tells us how much the cost will change if we change the parameter by a small amount. We then update each parameter by subtracting a fraction of the gradient from the current value of the parameter. This fraction is known as the learning rate, and it determines how big of a step we take in each iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The process of updating the parameters is repeated until the cost function converges to a minimum, or until a predetermined stopping criterion is met.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gradient descent can be used with various machine learning algorithms, including linear regression, logistic regression, and neural networks. It is particularly useful for models with a large number of parameters, as it can efficiently search the parameter space and find a good set of values that minimize the cost function.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the key challenges of gradient descent is choosing an appropriate learning rate. If the learning rate is too high, the algorithm may overshoot the minimum and fail to converge. If the learning rate is too low, the algorithm may converge too slowly and get stuck in local minima.\n",
    "\n",
    "To overcome these challenges, various extensions of gradient descent have been developed, including stochastic gradient descent (SGD), mini-batch gradient descent, and adaptive learning rate algorithms such as Adam and RMSprop. These algorithms adjust the learning rate during training and use random subsets of the data to update the parameters, which can improve the speed and stability of the optimization process.\n",
