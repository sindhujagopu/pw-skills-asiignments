    "PageRank Algorithm: The PageRank algorithm, used by search engines like Google, ranks web pages based on their importance in the web graph. The algorithm relies on Eigen-Decomposition to compute the stationary distribution of the Markov matrix representing the web graph. The stationary distribution corresponds to the eigenvector of the Markov matrix with eigenvalue 1. By iteratively computing the eigenvector, the PageRank algorithm assigns higher ranks to web pages that are linked to by other important pages. Eigen-Decomposition plays a crucial role in this algorithm by identifying the most influential web pages based on the connectivity patterns in the web graph.\n",

    "These are just a few examples of how Eigen-Decomposition is useful in data analysis and machine learning. It is a versatile tool that enables various techniques for dimensionality reduction, clustering, ranking, and more, by extracting important information from matrices through the decomposition process."
