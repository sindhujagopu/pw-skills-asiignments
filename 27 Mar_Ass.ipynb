However, it is rare to achieve an R2 value of 1 in practice, as there is almost always some unexplained variation in the data.\n",

It is also possible to have a high R2 value even if the model is not a good fit to the data, if there are omitted variables or if the relationship between the variables is non-linear. Therefore, R2 should be used in conjunction with other statistical measures and diagnostic tests to evaluate the overall performance of a linear regression model."

As a result, Lasso tends to produce sparse coefficient estimates, as it forces many coefficients to be exactly zero.
