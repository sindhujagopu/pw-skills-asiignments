    "3.Explain why the --init--() functiom is used. Give a suitable example.\n",
    "\n",
    "The __init__ method, also known as the constructor method, is used in Python to initialize an object's state when it is created. The __init__ method is called automatically when an object is created from a class, and it allows you to set the default values for the object's attributes. This is useful because it ensures that every object created from the class has the necessary attributes and their values set, without having to manually set them each time an object is created.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider a class called \"Person\" that defines the attributes of a person, such as name, age, and address. The __init__ method can be used to set the default values for these attributes when a person object is created, like so:\n",
    "\n",
    "EX:\n",
    "\n",
    "class Person:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name, age, address):\n",
    "        self.name = name\n",
    "        self.age = age\n",
    "        self.address = address\n",
    "\n",
    "person1 = Person(\"John Doe\", 30, \"123 Main St.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the __init__ method takes three arguments name, age, and address and sets them as the default values for the name, age, and address attributes, respectively, when a Person object is created. When the person1 object is created, the __init__ method is automatically called, and the values \"John Doe\", 30, and \"123 Main St.\" are used to initialize the person1 object's state."

    "4.Why self is used in oops?\n",
    "\n",
    "The self keyword is used in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) to refer to the instance of an object being operated on within a method. In Python, every method defined in a class must include the self parameter as its first argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of using self is to provide a way to access the attributes and methods of an object from within the class. The self parameter refers to the specific instance of the object that is calling the method, and it allows you to access the attributes and methods of that object. This way, you can access the attributes and methods of an object and modify its state, without having to make the attributes and methods global."
